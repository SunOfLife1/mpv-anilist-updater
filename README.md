This is a fork of [mpv-anilist-updater](https://github.com/AzuredBlue/mpv-anilist-updater) for my own personal usage that uses the episode's title instead of the file path. My reasoning for this is that the original script doesn't work when used with [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli). That's it. Please just look at the original script for any useful information.
